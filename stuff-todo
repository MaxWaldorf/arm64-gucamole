# 20 MAR 2022 (todo):
#
#	1) The documentation states that ARM 32-bit is not supported, however, the code in
#	in the repo suggests otherwise. Need to perform some tests to ascertain if ARMv7
#	architecture would build and function properly.
#	2) What would be requisite to effectuate using MySQL instead of postgresql?
#	MySQL seems a better choice as far more Guacamole users are ostensibly familiar with it.
